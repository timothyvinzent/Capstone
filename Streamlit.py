## make a selection for different location, we just build in the selector, based on the dataset we collect we display a different image at the top of the location
## Also integrate some intelligence on the stats of the time series
## add in some examples on the ideal crop timing, could use fake values for now
## integrate a market analysis tool for the production and supply of different crop types in your region using FAO stat
## the get location has to be faked for now to be able to deploy on streamlit share
## create a connect to experts page, confrence date, match making functionality, maybe we could fake it a little bit for now
## Create a fake page on the current state of spring and the stuff they are doing
## create a fake page about the mockups, or just put the presentation in there
